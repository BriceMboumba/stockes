In order to highlight my knowledge both in the development of web and data applications, I chose to develop a web service with a artificial intelligence that can predict Tesla shares on the stock market. The objective of this application is to predict the closing price of the day's stock,in terms of :
  ● its opening value (open).
  ● its highest value (high).
  ● its lowest value (low).
  ● and its volume (volume).
